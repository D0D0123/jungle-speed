# ðŸŒ´ Jungle Speed - Multiplayer Web Game

A real-time multiplayer implementation of the classic Jungle Speed card game built with React and Node.js.

## Game Overview

Jungle Speed is a fast-paced card game where players race to grab a bottle when certain conditions are met. The goal is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards.

### Game Rules

1. **Setup**: Players sit in a circle around a bottle. Each player gets a deck of cards.
2. **Turns**: Players take turns drawing the top card from their deck and placing it face-up.
3. **Matching**: When two active cards match (same value), those players race to grab the bottle.
4. **Jokers**: When a Jack/Joker is drawn, any player can grab the bottle.
5. **Winning**: The winner of a bottle grab gives their used stack to opponents.
6. **Penalties**: Wrong grabs result in collecting all other players' used stacks.
7. **Victory**: First player to empty their draw deck and have no active card wins.
